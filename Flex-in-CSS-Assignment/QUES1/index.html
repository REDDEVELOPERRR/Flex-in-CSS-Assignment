<h1>WHICH TO CHOOSE WHEN?</h1>
<p>choice between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid depends on your specific layout needs. If you're working with a one-dimensional layout, Flexbox is likely the better choice. If you need a two-dimensional layout with more precise control over both rows and columns, CSS Grid is the way to go. Often, you may use them in combination to achieve complex layouts that require both one-dimensional and two-dimensional structuring.</p>
